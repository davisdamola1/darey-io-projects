### MEAN STACK DEPLOYMENT TO UBUNTU IN AWS

#### Installing Nodejs:
* Before commencing, I ensured ubuntu was up to date. So I updated and upgraded ubuntu:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
* I added certificates as a prerequisite for installing node using:
```
 sudo apt -y install curl dirmngr apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates
 curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
 ```

 * Then I installed NodeJS using:
```
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

#### Installing MongoDB
* Before installing MongoDB, I had to import the public key for MongoDB:
```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 0C49F3730359A14518585931BC711F9BA15703C6
```
* I also had to add MongoDBâ€™s APT repository to the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory:
```
echo "deb [ arch=amd64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu trusty/mongodb-org/3.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.4.list
```


##### Body-parser package was installed with node package manager but I get this message:
*npm WARN saveError ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/ubuntu/package.json'
npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.
