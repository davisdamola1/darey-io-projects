### MEAN STACK DEPLOYMENT TO UBUNTU IN AWS

##### STEP 1 - INSTALL Nodejs:
##### Body-parser package was installed with node package manager but I get this message:
*npm WARN saveError ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/ubuntu/package.json'
npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.
npm WARN enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/ubuntu/package.json'
npm WARN ubuntu No description
npm WARN ubuntu No repository field.
npm WARN ubuntu No README data
npm WARN ubuntu No license field*
##### Seems to have installed however.
